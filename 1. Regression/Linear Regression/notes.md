### Issue with high learning rate

Setting the learning rate to 1 in linear regression may result in unstable and unpredictable behavior during training. This is because a learning rate of 1 means that the model updates its parameters by a large amount in each iteration, which can cause the parameters to overshoot the optimal values and diverge from the correct solution.
In general, a high learning rate can lead to the model not converging at all or converging to a suboptimal solution. It's usually recommended to start with a smaller learning rate (e.g. 0.01 or 0.001) and gradually increase it if the model is not learning quickly enough.
However, the optimal learning rate depends on the specific problem and dataset, and it's usually determined through experimentation. Therefore, it's recommended to try different learning rates and see which one works best for your problem.

### Ideal Iterations

The ideal number of iterations for linear regression depends on several factors, including the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model, the learning rate, and the convergence criterion.
In general, the number of iterations should be set such that the model has converged to the optimal solution. Convergence means that the change in the model's parameters (weights) between consecutive iterations is small enough. One way to check for convergence is to monitor the decrease in the cost function (e.g. mean squared error) as the number of iterations increases.
If the cost function decreases rapidly and then levels off, the model has likely converged, and further iterations will not improve its performance significantly. On the other hand, if the cost function is still decreasing rapidly, the model may benefit from additional iterations.
However, be cautious not to overfit the model to the training data. Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data too closely and becomes less accurate on new data. To avoid overfitting, you can use techniques such as cross-validation and regularization.
Therefore, the ideal number of iterations for linear regression varies based on the specific problem, and it's usually determined through experimentation and validation techniques.
